## 🎯 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Starting from theoretical foundations to practical implementations in PyTorch.

**Duration**: Week 1 of my ML Learning Challenge (Feb 13-19, 2026)

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- [x] Understand RNN architecture and sequential data processing
- [x] Implement character-level RNN from scratch
- [ ] Master LSTM architecture (gates and cell states)
- [ ] Compare RNN vs LSTM performance
- [ ] Build sentiment analysis system with LSTM
- [ ] Create stock price predictor using LSTM

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### RNN Fundamentals
- **Sequential Processing**: How RNN processes data one step at a time
- **Hidden State**: The "memory" that persists across time steps
- **Parameter Sharing**: Same weights across all time steps
- **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: How gradients flow backward

### LSTM Improvements
- **Forget Gate**: Decides what to remove from cell state
- **Input Gate**: Decides what new information to add
- **Output Gate**: Decides what to output based on cell state
- **Cell State**: Long-term memory pathway

### Practical Insights
- When to use RNN vs LSTM
- Hyperparameter tuning for sequence models
